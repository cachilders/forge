TODO
- Clean up all the global space pollution with proper object returns and locals
- Add "No Crow Connected" state if crow is output
- Generalize midi init away from outputs for better adoption of cc-as-lfo type inputs in future
- - Move Panic to the resulting class
- test and relocate convert_raw_voltage_to_note_number
- Fix drawing bug (lines between objects) if possible (low priority honestly because it looks good)
