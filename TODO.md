TODO
- Clean up all the includes with proper object returns and locals and manage in a file
- Add "No Crow Connected" state if crow isdisconnected while input/output
- Generalize midi init away from outputs for better adoption of cc-as-lfo type inputs in future
- - Move Panic to the resulting class
- Fix drawing bug (lines between objects) if practical (low priority honestly because it looks good)
