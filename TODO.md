TODO
- Notes are pooling behind the quantizer queue when transport is paused
- - This is one bug just because they should die if next notes is false
- - But another because the generator should always be on regardless of play state or match the play state. it's starting off but not shutting off after being started
- Fix drawing bug (lines between objects) if possible (low priority honestly because it looks good)
- Add "No Crow Connected" state
- Make additional player output devices (midi, crow volts, etc)
- - Crow is raw volts 1/2 and quant volts 3/4
- - Devices added to a play object that sends played notes to them
- sc lfos as inputs maybe

- Params TODO:
- Allow cycle sampler min and max trims to be adjusted
- Allow octave count to be adjusted
- Scale selection
- Root selection
- Clock mult/div, etc
- Midi device, panic, etc
- Output device selection (crow is always on)
- Crow output settings (bipolar/unipolar, etc)
- Modulo for gating generation events
